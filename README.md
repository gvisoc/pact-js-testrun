# Pact-Js Test Run
This repository holds a basic test of a consumer and a producer (node modules `consumer` and `producer`) with consumer-driven contract tests written in Pact.

The consumer test is generating a pact contract file with dynamic matchers to check the validity of the request body (no exact match).

I maintain this repository as a reference for myself. Refer to the [official and up-to-date documentation of Pact-JS](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js).
